This project simulates a game of connectM where a user is playing against an agent that uses Alpha-Beta pruning to make moves.
This project is written in Java and instruction to run are as follows.
1. Download the zip file and open it in an IDE like Visual Studio Code.
2. Click Run to open the RUN terminal.
3. A drop down will ask to run the main file, click Main and the program will begin.
4. Input "connectM N M H" where N is the size you want for the board, M is the number of coins you want to connect, and H determines whether you want to play first (0) or second (1).
5. The board is then printed and depending who starts first will start the game. 
6. To input your play simply put the number of the column you want to drop a peice. For example, 1 will drop into the first column and your N value drops into the last column. Entering multiple values will simply skip your turn until all integers are played onto the board.
7. When a winner is acheived the program will quit. If an error is made enter Ctrl+C to end the program.
